# CCC '19 S2 - Pretty Average Primes

---

*This is a demo of Markdown, Asciimath, and Latex.*

**Canadian Computing Competition: 2019 Stage 1, Senior #2**

*[Asciimath](http://asciimath.org/): Use* `@@` *as delimiters.*

*Latex: Use* `\\(` *and* `\\)` *for inline math* \\(x+y\\)*, and* `\\[` *with* `\\]` *for display math* \\[x+y\\]
*Two backslashes are required since the Markdown renderer uses* `\` *as an escape character thus* `\\` *produces* \\.

***Avoid mixing Asciimath and Latex within the same paragraph, this works very unreliably.***

For various given positive integers @@N>3@@, find two primes, @@A@@ and @@B@@ such that @@N@@ is the average (mean) of @@A@@ and @@B@@. That is, @@N@@ should be equal to @@(A+B)/2@@.

Recall that a prime number is an integer \\(P>1\\) which is only divisible by \\(1\\) and \\(P\\). For example, \\(2, 3, 5, 7, 11\\) are the first few primes, and \\(4, 6, 8, 9\\) are not prime numbers.

## Input Specification

The first line of input is the number @@T@@ (@@1<=T<=1000@@), which is the number of test cases. Each of the next @@T@@ lines contain one integer @@N_i@@ (@@4<=N_i<=1000000@@, @@1<=i<=T@@).

For 6 of the available 15 marks, all \\(N_i< 1000\\).

## Output Specification

The output will consist of @@T@@ lines. The @@i^(th)@@ line of output will contain two integers, @@A_i@@ and @@B_i@@, separated by one space. It should be the case that @@N_i=(A_i+B_i)/2@@ and that @@A_i@@ and @@B_i@@ are prime numbers.

If there are more than one possible @@A_i@@ and @@B_i@@ for a particular @@N_i@@, output any such pair. The order of the pair @@A_i@@ and @@B_i@@ does not matter.

It will be the case that there will always be at least one set of values \\(A_i\\) and \\(B_i\\) for any given \\(N_i\\).

*Note: dubj does not support a grader that is order agnostic.*

## Sample Input 1

```
4
8
4
7
21
```

## Sample Output 1

```
3 13
5 3
7 7
13 29
```

## Explanation of Possible Output for Sample Input

Notice that:

\\begin{align}
  8 &= \\frac{3+13}{2} \\\\
  4 &= \\frac{5+3}{2} \\\\
  7 &= \\frac{7+7}{2} \\\\
  21 &= \\frac{13+29}{2}
\\end{align}

It is interesting to note, that we can also write

\\begin{align}
  8 &= \\frac{5+11}{2} \\\\
  21 &= \\frac{5+37}{2} = \\frac{11+31}{2} = \\frac{19+23}{2} \\\\
  7 &= \\frac{3+11}{2}
\\end{align}

and so any of these pairs could have also been used in output. There is no pairs of primes other than @@3@@ and @@5@@ which average to the value of @@4@@.
